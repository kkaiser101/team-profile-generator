# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project allows you to add members of your engineering team and display their information on a webpage (WIP) and console log. Currently, the program is able to generate an html page with the objects but the objects need to be displayed in the right format. Application tests are also a work in progress. However, the core code and functionality of the program is here, allowing you to see your team members in the console log. More will be added in the future to ensure all benchmarks are hit.
